# RPS-PJ
A FreshStart Project On The Take of DL and ML

- Learning PyTorch , CUDA etc...
- Trying use my 3080 Mobile to train a model.
- This is a very beginner level project , but needed to start somewhere else from strict Master's education.

CUDA Version: 12.4 | GPU Version: RTX 3080 Mobile ( With CUDA 12.5 Support ) 

For now This Repo Will only have the basics, since it will be aligned in the process of applying to internships on the side , I will slowly update so that even my camera can detect what RPS I am doing , maybe at last I can fight with the computer :).
